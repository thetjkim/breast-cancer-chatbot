# Breast Cancer Research Chatbot

This is an experimental chatbot designed to assist in understanding academic literature on breast cancer.

My name is TJ. After someone in my family was diagnosed with breast cancer, I started reading research papers to better understand the disease. During that process, I often wished for a way to retrieve and explore relevant findings more easily—something interactive, focused, and trustworthy. This project was born out of that wish.

The chatbot uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to answer questions based on a curated set of breast cancer research PDFs. It is built with LangChain, FAISS, OpenAI's GPT-4, and Streamlit.

> ⚠️ Disclaimer:  
> This is an early-stage prototype. While every effort has been made to reduce hallucination and enhance relevance, the chatbot's responses should not be considered authoritative or medically verified. Please double-check all information with trusted sources or professionals before making decisions.

Thank you for trying it out.
