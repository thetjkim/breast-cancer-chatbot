# Breast Cancer Research Chatbot

👉 [Try the chatbot live on Streamlit](https://breast-cancer-chatbot-kbngdjstp68zfz9kpjzuyp.streamlit.app)

This is an experimental chatbot designed to assist in understanding academic literature on breast cancer.

My name is TJ. After someone in my family was diagnosed with breast cancer, I started reading research papers to better understand the disease. During that process, I often wished for a way to retrieve and explore relevant findings more easily—something interactive, focused, and trustworthy. This project was born out of that wish.

The chatbot uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to answer questions based on a curated set of breast cancer research PDFs. It is built with LangChain, FAISS, OpenAI's GPT-4, and Streamlit.

> ⚠️ Disclaimer:  
> This is an early-stage prototype. While every effort has been made to reduce hallucination and enhance relevance, the chatbot's responses should not be considered authoritative or medically verified. Please double-check all information with trusted sources or professionals before making decisions.

Thank you for trying it out.
